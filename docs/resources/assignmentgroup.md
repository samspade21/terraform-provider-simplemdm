# simplemdm_assignmentgroup (Resource)

Assignment Group resource is used to manage group, you can assign App(s), Custom Profile(s), Device(s), Device Group(s) and set addition details regarding Assignemtn Group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "myfirstgroup" {
  // Group name required
  name = "My group name"
  //auto deploy true or false, default is true
  auto_deploy = true
  //group type "standard" or "munki", defaults to standard. If this parameter is changed it will destroy/create whole group
  group_type            = "standard"
  install_type          = "managed"
  priority              = 10
  app_track_location    = true
  apps                  = [123456]
  profiles              = [123456, 987654]
  groups                = [135431, 654321]
  devices               = [135431, 987654]
  devices_remove_others = false
  profiles_sync         = false
  apps_push             = false
