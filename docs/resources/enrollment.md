# simplemdm_enrollment (Resource)

Enrollment resource manages SimpleMDM enrollment links used for one-time and account driven enrollments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_enrollment" "account_driven" {
  device_group_id    = "1234"
  user_enrollment    = false
  welcome_screen     = true
  authentication     = false
  invitation_contact = "user@example.com"
}
```

```terraform
# Advanced Example - User enrollment with authentication
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "byod_devices" {
  name = "BYOD Devices"
}

resource "simplemdm_enrollment" "user_enrollment" {
  device_group_id = simplemdm_devicegroup.byod_devices.id
  user_enrollment = true
  welcome_screen  = true
  authentication  = true

  # Optional: Send invitation email
  invitation_contact = "byod-users@example.com"
}

output "enrollment_url" {
  description = "URL for users to enroll their devices"
  value       = simplemdm_enrollment.user_enrollment.url
  sensitive   = true
}

output "enrollment_id" {
  description = "Enrollment configuration ID"
  value       = simplemdm_enrollment.user_enrollment.id
}
```
