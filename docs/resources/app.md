# simplemdm_app (Resource)

App resource can be used to manage Apps.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_app" "marketing" {
  app_store_id = "1090161858"
  name         = "Marketing App"
  deploy_to    = "outdated" // Defaults to "none". Valid values: "none", "outdated", "all".
}

# Computed attributes such as `installation_channels`, `status`, or `version`
# can be referenced once the app has been created. This output illustrates how
# to inspect the deployment channels that SimpleMDM reports for the app.
output "marketing_installation_channels" {
  description = "Deployment channels supported by the Marketing App."
  value       = simplemdm_app.marketing.installation_channels
}
```

```terraform
# Deploy an existing Volume Purchase Program (VPP) app by referencing its
# bundle identifier. SimpleMDM resolves the bundle ID to the latest catalog
# metadata and makes it available to devices.
resource "simplemdm_app" "bundle_id_example" {
  bundle_id = "com.myCompany.MyApp1"
  deploy_to = "all" // Defaults to "none". Valid values: "none", "outdated", "all".
}

output "bundle_id_app_status" {
  description = "Deployment status reported by SimpleMDM for the bundle ID app."
  value       = simplemdm_app.bundle_id_example.status
}
```

```terraform
# Upload a custom enterprise or macOS package app by providing a binary file.
# The provider will post the binary to SimpleMDM and keep the metadata in sync.
resource "simplemdm_app" "enterprise" {
  name        = "Internal Tools"
  binary_file = "${path.module}/files/internal-tools.pkg"
}

output "enterprise_processing_status" {
  description = "Processing state for the uploaded enterprise app binary."
  value       = simplemdm_app.enterprise.processing_status
}
```
