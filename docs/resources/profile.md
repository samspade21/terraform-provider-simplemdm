# simplemdm_profile (Resource)

Provides read-only access to existing configuration profiles in SimpleMDM. This resource is designed for referencing profiles that are managed outside of Terraform or created through the SimpleMDM web interface. It does not create or modify profiles.

**Note**: This is a read-only resource. All attributes except `id` are computed and cannot be modified through Terraform.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_profile" "existing" {
  id = "123456"
}
```

### Advanced Example - Reference Profile Details

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_profile" "security_profile" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "profile_info" {
  value = {
    name       = simplemdm_profile.security_profile.name
    type       = simplemdm_profile.security_profile.type
    identifier = simplemdm_profile.security_profile.profile_identifier
    sha        = simplemdm_profile.security_profile.profile_sha
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Assignment Group Reference

```terraform
# Reference an existing profile for use in assignment groups
resource "simplemdm_profile" "wifi_profile" {
  id = "789012"
}

resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "employees" {
  name     = "All Employees"
  profiles = [simplemdm_profile.wifi_profile.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Conditional Logic

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_profile" "optional_profile" {
  id = "123456"
}

# Only create assignment if profile is active
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "conditional" {
  count = simplemdm_profile.optional_profile.auto_deploy ? 1 : 0
  
  name     = "Conditional Group"
  profiles = [simplemdm_profile.optional_profile.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Multiple Profile References

```terraform
# Reference multiple existing profiles
locals {
  profile_ids = ["123456", "234567", "345678"]
}

resource "simplemdm_profile" "profiles" {
  for_each = toset(local.profile_ids)
  id       = each.value
}

# Use all profiles in an assignment group
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "multi_profile" {
  name     = "Multi-Profile Group"
  profiles = [for p in simplemdm_profile.profiles : p.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Profile Inspection

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_profile" "inspect" {
  id = "123456"
}

# Output profile metadata for inspection
output "profile_metadata" {
  value = {
    name              = simplemdm_profile.inspect.name
    source            = simplemdm_profile.inspect.source
    type              = simplemdm_profile.inspect.type
    device_count      = simplemdm_profile.inspect.device_count
    group_count       = simplemdm_profile.inspect.group_count
    created_at        = simplemdm_profile.inspect.created_at
    updated_at        = simplemdm_profile.inspect.updated_at
    attribute_support = simplemdm_profile.inspect.attribute_support
    user_scope        = simplemdm_profile.inspect.user_scope
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) ID of an existing profile in SimpleMDM.

### Read-Only

- `attribute_support` (Boolean) Whether the profile supports attribute substitution.
- `auto_deploy` (Boolean) Whether the profile is auto-deployed when assigned.
- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the profile was created.
- `device_count` (Number) Number of devices currently assigned to the profile.
- `escape_attributes` (Boolean) Whether attribute values are escaped during installation.
- `group_count` (Number) Number of device groups currently assigned to the profile.
- `group_ids` (Set of String) IDs of device or assignment groups currently assigned to the profile.
- `install_type` (String) The install type configured for the profile.
- `name` (String) The name of the profile.
- `profile_identifier` (String) The identifier contained within the profile payload.
- `profile_sha` (String) SHA hash reported by SimpleMDM for the profile contents.
- `reinstall_after_os_update` (Boolean) Whether the profile reinstalls automatically after macOS updates.
- `source` (String) Origin of the profile within SimpleMDM.
- `type` (String) The profile payload type reported by SimpleMDM.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the profile was last updated.
- `user_scope` (Boolean) Indicates if the profile installs in the user scope.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Profile can be imported by specifying the profile ID
terraform import simplemdm_profile.example 123456
```

## Notes

- **Read-Only Nature**: This resource provides read-only access to profiles. It cannot create, update, or delete profiles.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Reference profiles created through the SimpleMDM web interface
  - Query profile metadata for conditional logic
  - Include managed profiles in assignment groups
  - Inspect profile deployment status
- **Profile Types**: This resource works with all SimpleMDM profile types (built-in, custom, etc.).
- **Source Attribute**: The `source` attribute indicates how the profile was created (e.g., "web", "api", "catalog").
- **Device/Group Counts**: The counts reflect current assignments and update on each Terraform refresh.
- **Assignment**: Use the profile ID in `simplemdm_assignmentgroup` or `simplemdm_device` resources to assign profiles.
- **Custom Profiles**: For managing custom profiles, use the `simplemdm_customprofile` resource instead.
- **Drift Detection**: Changes to profiles made outside Terraform will be detected on the next refresh.
