# simplemdm_devicegroup (Resource)

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This resource is deprecated.** Device Groups have been superseded by Assignment Groups in SimpleMDM.

**Please migrate to:** [`simplemdm_assignmentgroup`](assignmentgroup.md)

This resource is maintained for backward compatibility only and may be removed in a future major version.

### Migration Guide

Assignment Groups provide all the functionality of Device Groups with additional features:

1. Replace `simplemdm_devicegroup` resources with `simplemdm_assignmentgroup`
2. Update any data source references from `simplemdm_devicegroup` to `simplemdm_assignmentgroup`
3. Assignment Groups support the same attributes (profiles, customprofiles, attributes) plus additional capabilities

**Before (deprecated):**
```terraform
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "example" {
  name           = "My Group"
  profiles       = [123456]
  customprofiles = [456123]
  attributes = {
    "key" = "value"
  }
}
```

**After (recommended):**
```terraform
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "example" {
  name     = "My Group"
  profiles = [123456]
  # Assignment groups can include both profiles and custom profiles in the profiles attribute
  # Additional features like auto_deploy, priority, etc. are also available
}
```
