# simplemdm_devicegroup (Resource)

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This resource is deprecated.** Device Groups have been superseded by Assignment Groups in SimpleMDM.

**Please migrate to:** [`simplemdm_assignmentgroup`](assignmentgroup.md)

This resource is maintained for backward compatibility only and may be removed in a future major version.

### Why Assignment Groups?

Assignment Groups are the modern replacement for Device Groups, providing:
- Enhanced functionality for app and profile deployment
- Better device organization capabilities
- Improved automation features
- Support for priority-based group evaluation
- Integration with SimpleMDM's New Groups Experience

### Migration Guide

Assignment Groups provide all the functionality of Device Groups with additional features:

1. Replace `simplemdm_devicegroup` resources with `simplemdm_assignmentgroup`
2. Update any data source references from `data.simplemdm_devicegroup` to `data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup`
3. Assignment Groups support the same attributes (profiles, customprofiles, attributes) plus additional capabilities

**Before (deprecated):**
```terraform
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "engineering" {
  name           = "Engineering Team"
  profiles       = [123456]
  customprofiles = [456123]
  attributes = {
    department = "Engineering"
    cost_center = "ENG-001"
  }
}
```

**After (recommended):**
```terraform
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "engineering" {
  name        = "Engineering Team"
  auto_deploy = true
  priority    = 10
  profiles    = [123456, 456123]  # Combine profiles and customprofiles
  # Additional features available:
  # - apps assignment
  # - device assignment
  # - automated deployment controls
}
```

## Original Documentation

Device Group resource can be used to manage device groups. Can be used together with custom profiles, attributes, assignment groups, or other device groups to set additional details.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "sales" {
  name = "Sales Team"
}
```

### Advanced Example - With Profiles

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "marketing" {
  name = "Marketing Devices"
  
  profiles = [
    "123456",  # Built-in profile
    "234567",
  ]
  
  customprofiles = [
    "456123",  # Custom profile
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Clone Existing Group

```terraform
# Clone configuration from an existing group
resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "new_team" {
  name       = "New Team"
  clone_from = "123456"  # ID of existing group to clone from
}
```

### Advanced Example - With Attributes

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_attribute" "department" {
  name = "department"
}

resource "simplemdm_attribute" "location" {
  name = "location"
}

resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "regional_office" {
  name = "Regional Office"
  
  attributes = {
    department = "Operations"
    location   = "West Coast"
  }
  
  profiles       = ["123456"]
  customprofiles = ["789012"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the device group.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) Map of custom attribute names to values set for this device group.
- `clone_from` (String) Clone configuration from an existing legacy device group. Changing this value forces a new device group to be created.
- `customprofiles` (Set of String) List of custom configuration profile IDs assigned to this device group.
- `profiles` (Set of String) List of configuration profile IDs assigned to this device group.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the device group in SimpleMDM.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Device group can be imported by specifying the numeric identifier
terraform import simplemdm_devicegroup.example 123456
```

## Notes

- **Deprecation Timeline**: While there is no immediate removal planned, new projects should use Assignment Groups.
- **Clone Behavior**: The `clone_from` parameter copies configuration from an existing group at creation time. Changes to this parameter force recreation.
- **Profile Assignment**: Devices in the group inherit all assigned profiles and custom profiles.
- **Attribute Precedence**: Device-level attributes override group-level attributes, which override global defaults.
- **Migration Path**: Existing device groups can continue to function, but migrating to assignment groups is recommended for new features.
- **New Groups Experience**: Accounts using SimpleMDM's New Groups Experience should use Assignment Groups exclusively.
