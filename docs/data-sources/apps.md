# simplemdm_apps (Data Source)

Fetches the collection of apps from your SimpleMDM account, with optional filtering by shared catalog.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List all apps in your SimpleMDM account
data "simplemdm_apps" "all" {}

# Output the first app's name
output "first_app_name" {
  value = length(data.simplemdm_apps.all.apps) > 0 ? data.simplemdm_apps.all.apps[0].name : "No apps found"
}

# Output all app IDs
output "app_ids" {
  value = [for app in data.simplemdm_apps.all.apps : app.id]
}
```

```terraform
# List all apps including shared catalog apps
data "simplemdm_apps" "all_with_shared" {
  include_shared = true
}

# Filter apps by type
output "app_store_apps" {
  value = [for app in data.simplemdm_apps.all_with_shared.apps : app.name if app.app_type == "app store"]
}

# Filter apps by platform
output "ios_apps" {
  value = [for app in data.simplemdm_apps.all_with_shared.apps : app.name if app.platform_support == "iOS"]
}
```
