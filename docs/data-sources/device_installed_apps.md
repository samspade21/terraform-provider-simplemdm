# simplemdm_device_installed_apps (Data Source)

Retrieves the list of installed applications on a SimpleMDM device. This data source provides information about all apps currently installed on a specific device, including both managed and unmanaged applications.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "laptop_apps" {
  device_id = "123456"
}

output "app_count" {
  value = length(data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.laptop_apps.installed_apps)
}
```

### Advanced Example - Parse App Attributes

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "device_apps" {
  device_id = "123456"
}

locals {
  apps = [
    for app in data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.device_apps.installed_apps :
    jsondecode(app.attributes_json)
  ]
}

output "installed_apps" {
  value = [for app in local.apps : app.name]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Filter Managed Apps

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "all_apps" {
  device_id = "123456"
}

locals {
  parsed_apps = [
    for app in data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.all_apps.installed_apps :
    jsondecode(app.attributes_json)
  ]
  
  managed_apps = [
    for app in local.parsed_apps :
    app if lookup(app, "managed", false) == true
  ]
}

output "managed_app_names" {
  value = [for app in local.managed_apps : app.name]
}
```

### Advanced Example - App Inventory Report

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "inventory" {
  device_id = "123456"
}

locals {
  apps_list = [
    for app in data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.inventory.installed_apps :
    jsondecode(app.attributes_json)
  ]
}

output "app_inventory" {
  value = {
    total_apps = length(local.apps_list)
    apps = [
      for app in local.apps_list : {
        name         = lookup(app, "name", "Unknown")
        version      = lookup(app, "version", "Unknown")
        bundle_id    = lookup(app, "bundle_identifier", "Unknown")
        managed      = lookup(app, "managed", false)
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Check for Specific App

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "check_device" {
  device_id = "123456"
}

locals {
  apps = [
    for app in data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.check_device.installed_apps :
    jsondecode(app.attributes_json)
  ]
  
  has_slack = anytrue([
    for app in local.apps :
    lookup(app, "bundle_identifier", "") == "com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap"
  ])
}

output "slack_installed" {
  value = local.has_slack ? "Slack is installed" : "Slack not found"
}
```

### Advanced Example - Multiple Devices Audit

```terraform
locals {
  device_ids = ["123456", "234567", "345678"]
}

data "simplemdm_device_installed_apps" "devices_apps" {
  for_each  = toset(local.device_ids)
  device_id = each.value
}

output "devices_app_counts" {
  value = {
    for device_id, apps_data in data.simplemdm_device_installed_apps.devices_apps :
    device_id => length(apps_data.installed_apps)
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `device_id` (String) Identifier of the device.

### Read-Only

- `installed_apps` (Block List) Collection of installed applications on the device. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--installed_apps))

<a id="nestedblock--installed_apps"></a>
### Nested Schema for `installed_apps`

Read-Only:

- `attributes_json` (String) Raw attributes payload returned by the API in JSON format.
- `id` (String) Installed app identifier.
- `type` (String) Installed app resource type.

## Notes

- **JSON Parsing**: Use `jsondecode()` to parse the `attributes_json` field and access app details.
- **App Attributes**: Common attributes in the JSON payload include:
  - `name` - Application name
  - `version` - App version
  - `bundle_identifier` - Bundle ID
  - `managed` - Whether the app is managed by MDM
  - `size` - App size in bytes
  - `install_date` - Installation timestamp
- **Managed vs Unmanaged**: Both MDM-managed and user-installed apps are included in the results.
- **Platform Support**: This data source works for both iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices.
- **Real-time Data**: The list reflects the most recent inventory data reported by the device.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Audit installed applications across devices
  - Verify required apps are installed
  - Identify unauthorized applications
  - Track app versions for compliance
  - Generate inventory reports
  - Detect specific apps for conditional logic
