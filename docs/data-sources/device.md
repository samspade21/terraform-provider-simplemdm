# simplemdm_device (Data Source)

Retrieves information about a device in SimpleMDM. This data source provides read-only access to device details including metadata, group assignments, and enrollment information.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device" "laptop" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "device_name" {
  value = data.simplemdm_device.laptop.name
}
```

### Advanced Example - Query Device Details

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device" "iphone" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "device_info" {
  value = {
    name         = data.simplemdm_device.iphone.name
    device_name  = data.simplemdm_device.iphone.devicename
    device_group = data.simplemdm_device.iphone.devicegroup
    serial       = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.iphone.details, "serial_number", "N/A")
    model        = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.iphone.details, "model", "N/A")
    os_version   = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.iphone.details, "os_version", "N/A")
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Use in Assignment Group

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device" "executive_laptop" {
  id = "123456"
}

resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "executives" {
  name    = "Executive Devices"
  devices = [data.simplemdm_device.executive_laptop.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Conditional Logic

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device" "check_device" {
  id = "123456"
}

locals {
  is_macos = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.check_device.details, "platform", "") == "macOS"
}

# Only create script job for macOS devices
resource "simplemdm_scriptjob" "conditional" {
  count      = local.is_macos ? 1 : 0
  script_id  = "789012"
  device_ids = [data.simplemdm_device.check_device.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example - Extract Device Attributes

```terraform
data "simplemdm_device" "production_device" {
  id = "123456"
}

# Extract custom attributes from details
locals {
  department  = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.production_device.details, "department", "")
  cost_center = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.production_device.details, "cost_center", "")
  location    = lookup(data.simplemdm_device.production_device.details, "location", "")
}

output "device_attributes" {
  value = {
    department  = local.department
    cost_center = local.cost_center
    location    = local.location
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Multiple Devices Lookup

```terraform
locals {
  device_ids = ["123456", "234567", "345678"]
}

data "simplemdm_device" "devices" {
  for_each = toset(local.device_ids)
  id       = each.value
}

output "devices_summary" {
  value = {
    for id, device in data.simplemdm_device.devices :
    device.name => {
      device_group = device.devicegroup
      hostname     = device.devicename
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of the device.

### Read-Only

- `details` (Map of String) Full set of attributes returned by the SimpleMDM API for the device.
- `devicegroup` (String) Device group identifier for the device.
- `devicename` (String) The hostname reported by the device.
- `enrollmenturl` (String) Enrollment URL generated for the device, when available.
- `name` (String) The SimpleMDM name of the device.

## Notes

- **Read-Only Access**: This data source provides read-only access to device information.
- **Details Map**: The `details` map contains all device information returned by SimpleMDM, including:
  - `serial_number` - Device serial number
  - `model` - Device model
  - `os_version` - Operating system version
  - `platform` - Device platform (iOS, macOS, etc.)
  - `status` - Enrollment status
  - Custom attributes set on the device
  - And many more fields
- **Enrollment URL**: Only available for devices created via API that haven't been enrolled yet.
- **Device Names**:
  - `name` - Display name in SimpleMDM
  - `devicename` - Local hostname of the device
- **Use Cases**:
  - Reference devices in assignment groups
  - Query device metadata for conditional logic
  - Extract device attributes for reporting
  - Validate device enrollment status
  - Build dynamic configurations based on device properties
