# simplemdm_devicegroup (Data Source)

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This data source is deprecated.** Device Groups have been superseded by Assignment Groups in SimpleMDM.

**Please migrate to:** [`simplemdm_assignmentgroup`](assignmentgroup.md)

This data source is maintained for backward compatibility only and may be removed in a future major version.

### Why Assignment Groups?

Assignment Groups are the modern replacement for Device Groups, providing:
- Enhanced functionality for app and profile deployment
- Better device organization capabilities  
- Improved automation features
- Support for priority-based group evaluation
- Integration with SimpleMDM's New Groups Experience

### Migration Guide

**Before (deprecated):**
```terraform
data "simplemdm_devicegroup" "legacy_group" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "group_name" {
  value = data.simplemdm_devicegroup.legacy_group.name
}
```

**After (recommended):**
```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "modern_group" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "group_name" {
  value = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.modern_group.name
}
```

## Original Documentation

Retrieves information about a device group in SimpleMDM. This data source provides read-only access to device group names.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
data "simplemdm_devicegroup" "sales" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "group_name" {
  value = data.simplemdm_devicegroup.sales.name
}
```

### Advanced Example - Multiple Groups

```terraform
locals {
  group_ids = ["123456", "234567"]
}

data "simplemdm_devicegroup" "groups" {
  for_each = toset(local.group_ids)
  id       = each.value
}

output "group_names" {
  value = {
    for id, group in data.simplemdm_devicegroup.groups :
    id => group.name
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) ID of a device group in SimpleMDM.

### Read-Only

- `name` (String) Device group name.

## Notes

- **Limited Functionality**: This data source only provides the group name. Assignment groups offer much more detailed information.
- **Deprecation Timeline**: While there is no immediate removal planned, new projects should use the assignment group data source.
- **Migration Path**: Existing configurations can continue to function, but migrating to assignment groups is recommended for access to enhanced features.
- **New Groups Experience**: Accounts using SimpleMDM's New Groups Experience should use Assignment Groups exclusively.
- **Use Cases** (Legacy):
  - Reference device group names
  - Query group existence
  - Basic group identification
