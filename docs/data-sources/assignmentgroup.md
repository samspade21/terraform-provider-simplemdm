# simplemdm_assignmentgroup (Data Source)

Retrieves information about an assignment group in SimpleMDM. This data source provides read-only access to assignment group details including assigned devices, groups, apps, and profiles.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "sales" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "group_name" {
  value = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.sales.name
}
```

### Advanced Example - Query Group Details

```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "engineering" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "group_details" {
  value = {
    name         = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.engineering.name
    device_count = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.engineering.device_count
    group_count  = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.engineering.group_count
    auto_deploy  = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.engineering.auto_deploy
    priority     = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.engineering.priority
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Reference in New Group

```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "template_group" {
  id = "123456"
}

# Create a new group with similar configuration
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "new_group" {
  name        = "New Group Based on Template"
  auto_deploy = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.template_group.auto_deploy
  priority    = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.template_group.priority
  apps        = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.template_group.apps
  profiles    = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.template_group.profiles
}
```

### Advanced Example - Conditional Logic

```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "production" {
  id = "123456"
}

# Only add apps if the group has auto-deploy enabled
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "conditional" {
  name = "Conditional Group"
  
  apps = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.production.auto_deploy ? [
    "789012",
    "890123"
  ] : []
}
```

### Advanced Example - Multiple Groups Lookup

```terraform
locals {
  group_ids = ["123456", "234567", "345678"]
}

data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "groups" {
  for_each = toset(local.group_ids)
  id       = each.value
}

output "groups_summary" {
  value = {
    for id, group in data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.groups :
    group.name => {
      devices  = group.device_count
      apps     = length(group.apps)
      profiles = length(group.profiles)
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example - Audit Group Assignments

```terraform
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "audit_target" {
  id = "123456"
}

output "assignment_audit" {
  value = {
    group_name       = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.name
    assigned_apps    = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.apps
    assigned_devices = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.devices
    assigned_groups  = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.groups
    assigned_profiles = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.profiles
    group_type       = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.group_type
    created_at       = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.created_at
    updated_at       = data.simplemdm_assignmentgroup.audit_target.updated_at
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of the assignment group.

### Read-Only

- `app_track_location` (Boolean) Whether the SimpleMDM app tracks device location when installed for this assignment group.
- `apps` (Set of String) IDs of apps assigned to the assignment group.
- `auto_deploy` (Boolean) Whether the assignment group automatically deploys apps.
- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the assignment group was created.
- `device_count` (Number) Number of devices currently assigned to the assignment group.
- `devices` (Set of String) IDs of devices assigned directly to the assignment group.
- `group_count` (Number) Number of device groups currently assigned to the assignment group.
- `group_type` (String) The type of assignment group (`standard` or `munki`).
- `groups` (Set of String) IDs of device groups assigned to the assignment group.
- `install_type` (String) Install type used when the assignment group is of type munki.
- `name` (String) The name of the assignment group.
- `priority` (Number) The priority of the assignment group.
- `profiles` (Set of String) IDs of profiles assigned to the assignment group.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the assignment group was last updated.

## Notes

- **Read-Only Access**: This data source provides read-only access to assignment group information.
- **Device/Group Counts**: The counts reflect current assignments and are updated on each Terraform refresh.
- **Assignment Lists**: The `apps`, `profiles`, `devices`, and `groups` attributes contain IDs that can be used to reference other resources.
- **Priority**: Lower priority numbers indicate higher precedence when devices belong to multiple groups.
- **Group Types**: 
  - `standard`: For MDM app/media deployments
  - `munki`: For Munki app deployments (deprecated)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Reference existing groups in new configurations
  - Audit group assignments and settings
  - Clone group configurations
  - Build conditional logic based on group properties
  - Monitor group membership counts
